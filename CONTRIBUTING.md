Contributing
============

We are open to, and grateful for, any contributions made by the community.


Submitting Proposals
--------------------

[Create an issue](https://github.com/stampit-org/stamp-specification/issues/new). Make sure it has the following:

### Simple Example
### Motivation
### Deeper Explanation
### API Proposal
### Additional Use Case Examples


Submitting Pull Requests
------------------------

A PR should be submitted after the related proposal issue is agreed on for implementation. The PR should contain both - the specification text changes, and the sample implementation (`compose.js`) changes.

After changing the `compose.js` sample implementation it is necessary to update and publish the new version of the [`check-compose`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/check-compose) module.
